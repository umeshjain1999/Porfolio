                   I have worked on many web development projects since the beginining of my egineering. I love designing websites ❤️, My 
                   contribution in any project is designing the structure and layout in a user friendly manner. I am always
                   excited in to learn new technologies which improves user interface.
                   Till now I have participated
                   in three hackathons (ByteCamp'19 , Codecell'19 , TSEC Hackathon'19). In all the hackathons, I have helped
                   my teams by desgining and creating user interface in 24 hours.
                   I'm known to technologies such as <span className = "about-lang"> HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, php, SQL, Python</span> and learning many more 🤘. 
                   Other than technical knowledge I love playing football ⚽️ and love to paint 👨‍🎨 things out of my imagination.
